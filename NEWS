Changes in 1.6
* fixed inspect.marker to not circle parents of F1 populations when they also appear in the prediction set

Changes in 1.5
* changed CC.anypop to allow markers called in the training set to be absent in the prediction set
* added max.missing.theta threshold to read.pop
* expanded language describing action of min.train=NULL
* add function usefitT
* changed inspect.marker naming convention for titles at tops of figures
* changed CC.anypop to name @pops “diverse” when parent1=NA (for fitTetra scores)

Changes in 1.4
* added impute option to CC.anypop

Changes in 1.3
* eliminated max.outlier.progeny parameter, as it proved unnecessary
* changes to calculation of posterior probability (.bayes.check, .fit.dist)
* changes to prevent lumping of prediction set clusters without training set genotypes
* implemented chi2p.step
* changes to allow selfing population to CC.bipop, CC.anypop, and inspect.marker

Changes in 1.2
* return NA for marker p(chi2) if categories other than expected DR products found
* no longer require that all expected categories have > 0 samples for CC.bipop
* hom.theta parameter now serves as boundary in two directions (i.e., homozygotes on one side, heterozygotes on other side)
* dosage to cluster assignment no longer allows for “gaps” in the sequence

Changes in 1.1
* read.pop - all samples must have unique sample names
* CC.anypop concordance, theta, and geno to include all markers that were supplied (NAs for those not used)
* corrections to .biparental.call function to call AAAA x BBBB -> AABB markers
* min.train parameter added to CC.bipop and CC.anypop
* changes to alter.pop keep=xxx, return pops, and inspect.marker to handle length(pop)==1

Changes in 1.0:
* Citation added, posted online
* error.checking=F default in read.pop
* inspect.marker vertical line placement fixed
* fixed indexing in CC.anypop@pops

Changes in 0.99
* edits to manual, add links
* alter.pop combines pops, removes/retains samples, merges samples

Changes in 0.98
* fix write.CC to write.pop <- the right name
* combine qc.pop and combine.pop, if it gets more than one pop, combines them
* bipop and anypop inherit pop
* changed read.pop to initiate a r matrix even if r.file=NULL, easier for merging ‘pop’ objects later

Changes in 0.97
* add a write.CC function to write genotype matrix
* rename conc.plot to plot.CC

Changes in 0.96
* add identical sample names warning to combine.pops, takes first sample if names appear more than once

Changes in 0.95
* rename parameter max.width to max.range

Changes in 0.94:
* can’t use ‘which’ to create index of populations for CC.anypop@pops because some genotypes may be represented 2x, fixed CC.anypop creation of ‘pops’
* in identity.plot and id.plot and CC.anypop changed ‘identity’ to ‘concordance’, rename id.plot as conc.plot

Changes in 0.93:
* changed wording ’matches’ to ‘equivalent’ in classes and read.pop
* changes to ‘combine.pops’ to record pop type
* changes to inspect.marker to take a list of pops/anypops, add names and vertical dashed lines between populations
* change wording ‘max.range’ to ‘max.width’ in CC.anypop, CC.bipop, optimize.params, auxiliary.functions 

Changes in 0.92:
* qc.pop defines r when eliminating samples

Changes in 0.91:
* inspect.marker now plots red dots for non-genotyped samples
