\details{
Hierarchical clustering within a biparental family is used to group samples with similar theta values, and then allele dosages are assigned to clusters based on expected segregation ratios, given the parental genotypes under the proposed clustering solution. 

For each marker, the number of sample clusters is varied from two to five. If a partitioning satisfies the \code{max.range} and \code{min.sep} thresholds and the fraction of samples with cluster membership probability less than \code{min.posterior} is less than \code{max.missing}, the partitioning is passed to the genotype assignment module.

In the genotype assignment module, clusterings with five clusters are assigned genotypes of {0,1,2,3,4} in order of ascending median theta value. With fewer than five clusters, several genotype-to-cluster assignments can be made. \code{CC.bipop} cycles through those possibilities that are consistent with segregation in a biparental population, allowing for double reduction products at a low frequency. 

When several plausible genotype-to-cluster assignments exist, the best solution is reported based on goodness-of-fit (highest p-value) to the expected genotype ratios under the assumption of random bivalent formation (i.e. random chromosome segregation) in meiosis.

Markers exceeding thresholds for all partitionings into two to five clusters are not assigned genotypes (i.e. not called).
